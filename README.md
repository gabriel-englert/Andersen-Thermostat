This repository contains the implementation of the Andersen thermostat in molecular dynamics simulations. The Andersen thermostat is used to maintain a constant temperature in a system by stochastically resetting the velocities of particles based on collisions with a thermal bath. The code compares the histograms of particle velocities in equilibrium with the theoretical Boltzmann distribution and analyzes the effect of the collision frequency parameter on the system.
